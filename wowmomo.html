    <h1 class="new">The Wow! Momo Story</h1>
    <div class="mid2">
       
        <div class="box">
            <p>Started by classmates Sagar Daryani and Binod Homagai,  Kolkata based <br> company Wow! Momo was started on 29th August 2008. Hailing from St <br>Xavier’s Kolkata in their final year of their graduation they took the final <br> plunge and decided to give consumers an experience and not just Momo! So simply they called it Wow! Momo.  The basic idea was to create an experience that would leave their customers with only one word and that is WOW!

                <br><br><br>If you have grown up in Kolkata – you ought to be a foodie and if you are a foodie you would know the fellow foodie’s centricity and preference.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box1">
            <p>
                Some of our wide range of products with which have experimented include Cheese Momos, Augratin,&nbsp; Sizzlers,&nbsp; Butter Masala Momo, Darjeeling Momo. The Moburg was a big innovation that rightly combined Momos with Burgers and was a lip-smacking meal for everyone. The journey from just playing with Momos to introducing so many new dishes has been challenging and excruciating but a roller coaster ride. 
   
                <br><br>
                Today Wow! Momo has over 300 outlets across 17 cities and the hunger and passion for what they do still lingers!	</p>
